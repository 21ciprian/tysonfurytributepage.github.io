# Tyson Fury Tribute page #


> I chose to make a tribute page of **Tyson Furry** because I was really impressed of him as a human being.
> He went through so much adversity in the past, from winning world titles to depression, anexiety and suicidal thougts.
> He battled his demons and made it back to the top and became a world champion again!
> He is definitely an inspiration for milions of people that are not at their best mentally and physically and showing them that the good times will come eventually and I admire him for that.

> Long live The Gipsy King!!!
